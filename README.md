# Linear-Regression
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables

We implemented linear regression with one variable to predict proÔ¨Åts for a bakery franchise. The objective of linear regression is to minimize the cost function

We also implemented linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses. We sued feature normalization. 

Both Gradient Descent and Normal Equations were used for both one variable and multiple variable regression.
